```lrc
[00:20.25] Yes indeed, here we are!
[00:23.34] At Saint Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast
[00:26.79] Where I stole the mar-juh-reen
[00:30.24] An' widdled on the Bingo Cards in lieu of the latrine
[00:35.41] I saw a handsome parish lady
[00:39.29] Make her entrance like a queen
[00:42.75] Why she was totally chenille
[00:45.12] And her old man was a Marine
[00:50.82] As she abused a sausage pattie
[00:53.94] And said why don't you treat me mean?
[00:56.08] (Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me, ooh)
[01:03.64] At Saint Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast
[01:05.48] (Hah! Good God! Get off the bus!)
[01:07.24] Where I stole the mar-juh-reen
[01:22.24] 
[01:38.44] Saint Alfonzo
[01:41.69] Saint Alfonzo
[01:43.19] Saint Alfonzo
[01:45.05] Saint Alfonzo
[01:46.64] Oo-oo-wah
